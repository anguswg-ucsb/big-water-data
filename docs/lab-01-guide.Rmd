> The RStudio terminal provides access to the **operating system (OS)** shell from within the RStudio IDE. Beneath the surface of any OS is an entire world that can only be accessed only from the **command line**. <br><br>The terminal is a gateway to that command line. <br><br>With it, instead of pointing and clicking, you can type commands and have your computer respond.

# **Goals**

- Make a folder for this class that will be the home for all your projects
- Learn how to make a new project in RStudio and build a reproducible & organized file structure within a project
- Learn to execute simple tasks within the RStudio terminal to create files and navigate our system directory
- Overcome the initial (and understandable!) anxiety associated with the terminal
- Install packages and load them into your environment
- Explore the basics of RStudio
- Understand the different data types & data structures in R
- Get comfortable working with the different data types & data structures

# **Create a folder for this class**

### **MacOS <i class="fa fa-apple" aria-hidden="true"></i>**

First, we will create a new folder on our desktop that we'll use to organize our RStudio projects for this class. 
Navigate to your desktop, and right click and click `New folder`. A new folder should appear on your desktop, to rename the folder, double click on the folder's name and give it the name `Rprojects`

### **Windows <i class="fa fa-windows" aria-hidden="true"></i>**

On windows, do the same thing but when you right click on the desktop hover over `New` and the click `Folder`

# **Create a new project in RStudio**

The terminal is a computer application. On a Mac, it is most frequently accessed via your _Terminal_ application (do yourself a favor and download [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/)), and on Windows, through _PowerShell_. Fortunately, RStudio provides a built in terminal that imitates these applications within the RStudio IDE. The **Terminal** tab can be found next to the **Console tab**. If it is not visible, show it via `Shift+Alt+T` (or Tools > Terminal > New Terminal). Once visible, it should look something like this:

Entering commands into the terminal is useful for expediting basic tasks like file/folder creation. The terminal is also useful for exploring your file structure, and for retrieving information about your computer system. 

> Here are 6 common commands that are useful for navigating a file system and creating files.

<br>

## <span class= "code" >pwd</span> - print working directory

pwd displays directory or folder you are currently in

```{bash,  engine="sh"}
pwd
```

<br>

## <span class= "code" >ls</span> - list files

ls shows the files in the current working directory. This is equivalent to looking at the files in your Finder/Explorer/File Manager. Use ls -a to also list hidden files, such as `.Rhistory` and `.git`. Here we look at all the files in current working directory:

```{bash}
ls
```

<br>

## <span class= "code">mkdir</span> - make a directory

mkdir creates a new folder (directory) inside your current working directory

to make a new folder called 'my_folder'

```{bash}
mkdir my_folder
ls
```

Notably we see our my-folder directory!

<br>

## <span class= "code" >cd</span> - change directory

cd allows you to navigate through directories by changing working directory. There are many ways to navigate:

### go to subdirectory of current working directory:

```{bash}
pwd # start here
cd my-folder
pwd # end here
```

### go to parent (one folder up) of current working directory: cd ..

```{bash}
pwd
cd ..
pwd
```
### go to your “home” directory: cd ~ or simply cd

```{bash}
pwd
cd ~
pwd
```

### Using absolute path, works regardless of your current working directory:. 

```{bash}
pwd
cd /Users/anguswg-ucsb/github/spds
pwd
```

Windows uses a slightly different syntax with the slashes between the folder names reversed, \, e.g. cd C:\Users\MY_USERNAME\Desktop.

**Pro tip 1:** Dragging and dropping a file or folder into the terminal window will paste the absolute path into the window.

**Pro tip 2:** Use the tab key to autocomplete unambiguous directory and file names. Hit tab twice to see all ambiguous options.

## <span class= "code">touch</span> - create a file

On a MacOS or Linux machine (anything running Bash) <span class = "code">touch</span>  can be used to create a new file with a defined name and extension in the working directory. For example, we can create a new R file named `new_r_file.R` in our working directory as follows:

```{bash, eval = TRUE}
touch new_r_file.R
ls
```

On a Windows machine (anything running Powershell) <span class = "code">$null ></span>  can be used to create a new file with a defined name and extension in the working directory. Essentially, this is piping no data (null) into a new file. For example, we can create a new R file in our working directory as follows:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
$null > new-r-file.R
```

<br>

## <span class= "code">clear</span> - clear your terminal window

```{r, eval = FALSE}
clear
```

```{bash, echo = FALSE}
rm -R my_folder
rm new_r_file.R
```
